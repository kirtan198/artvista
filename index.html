            <p class="text">There are about as many definitions of art as there are people alive. As a widely accepted definition, art is produced when imagination or creativity are used to create something that can be directly experienced through our senses. Although visual art that is witnessed through our sense of sight is the most common form, art can appeal to our other senses as well, such as our auditory or tactile perceptions.

            Sculpture is another ancient art form, dating back to some of the earliest civilizations. Unlike painting though, this form of art involves the creation of art in the three dimensions. The type of material used can be anything natural or artificial – from clay, metal, bronze, marble and wood to objects that artists come across in their everyday lives.

            Painting is one of the oldest kinds of art, dating back tens of thousands of years, and is evident on caves at various sites across the world, such as the Drakensberg in South Africa, the Northern Territory in Australia, and the Lascaux paintings in France to name only three of many sacred sites that are scattered across the globe. Some of these sites have become designated world heritage sites to preserve cultural history associated with those areas, and to preserve them.

        </div>
        <p class="text">
            People often identify architecture as going back to the very first structures that people built as dwellings. If we are to define architecture in this way, we can think of the teepee in America or the yurt in Mongolia. Some architecture has a distinct aesthetic quality though – indeed, the relationship between utility and beauty is sometimes central in architectural design as it is in other forms of art.

            The word “literature” is derived from the Latin word that is translated as “letters” and refers to the written word in particular. Language is a powerful and symbolic way of communicating, and writing is no exception. The earliest texts date back thousands of years to Mesopotamia, although it is thought that writing developed independently on different continents.

        </div>
        <p class="text">
            Music is created when there is an organization of sounds, as vibrations, that are put together to form an audible composition. Elements of a musical composition include harmony, timbre, melody, and rhythm. Although the presence of music in ancient civilization is harder to trace than visual art, remains of musical instruments have been found that are thousands of years old

        <p class="text">
            Relative to the other art types discussed in this article, cinema is a fairly recent form of art. Instead of attributing the development of cinema to one inventor, many great minds contributed to the entrance of cinema into people’s lives as is the case with many great inventions and discoveries of our time.
